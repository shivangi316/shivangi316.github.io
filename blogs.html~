    <p> the BYOD program is very nbeneficial to students. with this new policy change forcing us stidents to use school chromebooks that are utterly small and very slow can make school very difficult. especially with this new transfer to technology vs paper and pen. technology is leading the new way of schooling, and forcing 6ooo students to use school isued ancient chromebooks will make lives harder for everyone. also the liabillity and responsibility of entrusting students with computers not of their own money is a great disadvantage to the school. they should not be banning personal computers because many may also be foreign to chrombook usage. despite their idea of limiting games and technology distractions in classrooms, there are far more negative effects to come with a full transfer of school devices only.
