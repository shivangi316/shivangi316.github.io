    <p> in my groups was brook, rafid, matt, and shivangi(me). together we developed a game called SPACE ATTACK. space attack was a top down 2D game with a player spaceship VS. an enemy spaceship. you could obtain upgrades making it easier to kill enemies. as the game progressed the enemies became more difficult and you gained more points per enemy. it is basically a survive the longest game.</p>
    <p> our motivation to this game was to create something that everyone can play. something that wont get over immediatly and something that was fun and calming. with intricate images, and good code, we created this highly functional game that allowed for fun. and it wa sthe first thing the four of us could agree on.
    </p>
    <p> honestly, in the begining, nothing went as expected. becuase we had never dealt with a huge project just between the four of us, communication was a problem and so was debugging and coding. eventually we got in the rythym of it, but since we hadnt had much experience with all the languages and programs we needed to use it was a large learning process.</p>
    <h3> here are some code examples from our ISP</h3>

    <p>the first example(show above)
      <br> Placed var makes sure you cant use the connector again. Connector needs to still be there since the attachment might overlap and get destroyed. we need to stop the connector after an attachment is attached so that there arent multiple on one joint.

    <p>the second example(ahown above)
      <br> this peice of code moves the source point so that new attachments can be added without inflicting damage on the rest of the player </p>
