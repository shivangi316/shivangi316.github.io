      the government should not regulate AI cpaabilities. The AI is meant to be a tool or machine for the common people. Ai is a program, which is not detrimental to someones health somewhat even beneficial because it makes it easy to get answers for questions presented in the everyday world. the AI machines decrease research time allowing us humans to spend more time progressing our selves and our lives. if the government were to regulate AI usages, what would they do? they would set time lijmits on ai, preventing knowledge growth. although AI has influenced a new level of cheating, it is still beneficial to society for more than just a homework solver.

    <p> the BYOD program is very nbeneficial to students. with this new policy change forcing us stidents to use school chromebooks that are utterly small and very slow can make school very difficult. especially with this new transfer to technology vs paper and pen. technology is leading the new way of schooling, and forcing 6ooo students to use school isued ancient chromebooks will make lives harder for everyone. also the liabillity and responsibility of entrusting students with computers not of their own money is a great disadvantage to the school. they should not be banning personal computers because many may also be foreign to chrombook usage. despite their idea of limiting games and technology distractions in classrooms, there are far more negative effects to come with a full transfer of school devices only.
