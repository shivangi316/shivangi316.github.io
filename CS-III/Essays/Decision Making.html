     <p>
       Some say it’s inevitable to be unbiased, because a bias lies within an opinion, a statement, even a thought. Bias is a prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another usually in a way that's considered to be unfair. Biases may be held by an individual, group, or institution and can have negative or positive consequences. There are two types of biases: Conscious bias and Unconscious bias. Unconscious biases are social stereotypes about certain groups of people that individuals form outside their own conscious awareness. Everyone holds unconscious beliefs about various social and identity groups, and these biases stem from one's tendency to organize social worlds by categorizing. Unconscious bias is far more prevalent than conscious prejudice and often incompatible with one's conscious values. In our Independent Study Project (ISP), my group and I believe that bias will have a large impact on our final product. Some biases may be aesthetic, others functional, but each person in our group will have a different opinion; or in other words a bias towards one side. Some biases within the SHELTERSAFE project may include Adjustment bias, Sample bias, Overconfidence bias, Chance bias, and Attenuation bias.

     </p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h2 class="head">Bias 1 - Adjustment </h2>	 
     <p>
       What is adjustment bias? Adjustment bias is an ever-changing opinion, it's the idea of a skewed perception of new information. Adjustment bias will affect human judgment, causing one to overthink and second guess themself. I believe that Adjustment bias will have an impact on our ISP because Adjustment bias affects the opinion of decision makers.As a group many people will have different opinions on the functionality, usability, and look, we may even be coerced by a confident peer into believing something is perfect, even though subconsciously one disagrees. Although Adjustment Bias can have a negative effect, it can also be for the greater good, “In an environment of continuous feedback this can be an appropriate strategy. In most cases however, the amount of adjustment is insufficient”(Arnott, N.D.). In SheltersSafe, our group has had discussions on what we should do and how we should do it. Right now, we are in our beginning phase of the project, with little done, there is no ‘Adjustment’ to be made, therefore this bias may not affect us now, but will in the future as not all people see eye to eye. My way of personally overcoming this bias is to take into account everyones opinions and compromise. It's a group project, so I can't rein over the whole concept and looks, compromise is essential for success.

     </p>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h2 class="head"> Bias 2 - Sample </h2>
     <p>
       What is Sample bias? Sample bias is when fair and equal opportunity is not given to each test subject.  Sample bias affects testing, and testing outcomes. If we are hand selecting people who are smart or close friends, we won't get proper or meaningful results. This is statistically proven as a skew in a pole/vote. Sample bias will affect our testing stage in development, as we will be going to people we are in touch with (aka. friends) not people who will give a 100% honest opinion. One way I intend to limit sample bias in our project is to tell my friends to spread the word, that way not only will I get input from people I know, I will get input from people I have never even met. Sample bias has severe negative effects because without proper feedback and input in the problems of our website, we will never be able to fix nor perfect our project.

       </p>
     <br>
     <br>
     
     <h2 class="head"> Bias 3 - Overconfidence </h2>
     <p>
What is overconfidence bias? Overconfidence bias is caused by stubbornness and judgmental ability. Overconfidence bias can be caused by a large egomaniacal person or someone who refuses to listen and take input from others. One way overconfidence bias will take place in our project is the fact that some group members believe that they are “the best '' and don't like listening to others input. One way I personally intend to overcome this bias is to be open and to listen to everyone. I want to make sure that whatever work I do, everyone else also agrees  with whether its functionality or aesthetic, it's an all or nothing decision for this project. Overconfidence bias affects group functionality and deteriorates the quality of the final product. If you don't want to listen to your teammates, why should they listen to you?

     <br>
     <br>
     
     <h2 class="head"> Bias 4 - Chance </h2>
     <p>
What is chance bias? Chance bias is an element that can never be eliminated entirely, but it can be minimized through replication of measurements, and by increasing the size of the study. Chance bias points out flaws and determines the outlier in the study. Chance bias will play a part in the ShelterSafe project because it will be the main reason for testing and fixing bugs. The more tests and trials we do with ‘test subjects’ the more accurate and clean our project will be. Chance bias is not human directed but can be fixed and is instrumental to growth as engineers and the perfection of this project. One way I will try to limit the extremity of chance bias is by recording and overseeing all tests and trials, that way I can record and begin the debugging process before the deadline.

     </p>
     
     <br>
     <br>
     
     <h2 class="head"> Bias 5 - Attenuation </h2>
     <p>
What is attenuation bias? Attenuation bias refers to the undermining of certain aspects in a text that can have an exemplified effect that tends to cause havoc. Attenuation bias can lead to extremely negative circumstances as overlooking one small error can cause the entire project to crash. This will affect Project ShelterSafe as all humans (especially kids) make mistakes and if we ignore the slightest problem, the whole project will crash. One thing I will personally try to do is to double, even triple check the functionality of every piece of the project that I can. Hopefully this will limit the amount of overlooked items there are and significantly decrease the chances of bias and error.
