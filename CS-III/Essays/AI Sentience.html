      AI, Artificial intelligence, is NOT sentient. Being sentient means having feelings, emotions, and a voice. AI is a computer, is a code, is a multitude of 1s and 0s. Many believe that AI will randomly one day take over, that they can get up and control machines at their own will but that's far from the case. It's just the movie industry taking advantage of the simple minds and making profit.

In an article that covered an interview with two of the world's biggest tycoons,  Jack Ma and Elon Musk, they went over the debate of “is AI sentient?”. Essentially, both ELon Musk and Jack Ma agreed that AI is not sentient, but they also went over the pros and cons of AI, “One thing was clear from the top minds that AI will disrupt the future, making humans lazy and belittling others for not being as intelligent” (pradhan 2019). AI, artificial intelligence, is a machine or tool to increase the prosperity of life, it is to do things that don't require human intelligence or human manpower, such as a manning machinery or a conveyor line.  AI is the future. As a society we have advanced from stone tools to amazing computers and accessibility. AI is the next step but that doesnt mean AI is sentient(metz 2022). AI is a tool, a tool for human prosperity and growth, a tool to better humanity, and a tool to increase knowledge across the globe. In the interview, Musk stated that, “I think AI is going to open a new chapter for society; it will help humans understand ourselves better…”(pradhan 2019). With a similar view, Musk believes that AI is here to help mankind not to destroy mankind. One new chapter that is evidently an effect of AI is the increase in knowledge.

If AI controlled machines and electronics take manual labor jobs then there is a greater workforce or human body to become engineers and doctors to progress society farther and faster than ever before; who knows one day society might have the flying cars seen in movies!“Second, we don’t need a lot of jobs...artificial intelligence or robots will do that job.” “I think overtime AI will make jobs pointless. I’d recommend studying engineering because it’s into that kind of thing, or working on something where people can just interact with other people. Arts, of-course…”(pradhan 2019). This statement is supporting what was said earlier, that AI is taking manual labor away so that society as a whole can grow and advance faster than ever before. This is important because without technological advancements such as AI, human society would never grow and develop. But this doesn't imply that AI is sentient, in fact it's quite the opposite. AI is not sentient because they can only follow certain commands. They can not create anything out of thin air, they don't have superior intelligence to create their own commands, “In order for AI to achieve this, it would not only need to possess human-like intelligence, but it would also need to be able to predict the future or plan ahead.As it stands, AI is not capable of doing either.”(juapi 2022). Despite the fact that AI is not sentient, AI is integrated  into everyday lives, everyone is surrounded by AI all day long and they haven't realized it yet, “By now, most people around the world use some sort of AI-utilizing device that is integrated into their daily lives.” (juapi 2022). AI is essential to our everyday lives so we can't dismiss it as unimportant but we also can't call it sentient because it's not making any decisions by itself nor is it having any feelings in its everyday usage.

      Essentially, AI is not advanced enough to take over nor to become sentient. AI is still in its baby or dumb phase. Because it cannot create its own thoughts, it can only follow commands and rules, “The facts of the matter are that machines generally operate how they’re programmed to and we are a long way from developing the ASI (artificial superintelligence) needed for this “takeover” to even be feasible”(musser 2017). AI is not sentient, at least not yet. AI is a computer, it is extremely smart, it is reliable, and it is useful. But it does not have a mind of its own. Sentience is about feelings, character, being able to convey and create thoughts of your own. Humans have sentients but it took millions of years to develop into what it is now, AI is just starting its journey. And there's a long way to go from now.
