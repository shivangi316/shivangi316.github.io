	  <br>
	  significant acheivment plan for the week:
	  <br>
	  this week, i want to continue wy mork from last week. last week i made progress with implememting the app icon, however i struggled with implementing the tab icon. i cam accross errors and hold on the preview which due to unwrapping the images. my plan for this week is to research and come up with a unwrapping if statement or function. currently what i have is an iff statement that unwraps an image however the image is reading as null and not showing within the preview.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  the issue that i will be addressing is:
	  
	  <br>
	  tab icon implementation.  since they are already created all i have to do is implement them into designated areas/pages. to do that, i need to import ftp images into my shell and implement them on xcode via tablink. the only challenge i am seeing right now is the image unwrapping which is causing multiple errors. working on this should not take more than a day or two, should have icons implemented by the end of the week.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  pro tip: there is a small outline around the picture(for me its purple) you have to click that outline to be taken to the issue.

	  <br>

	  <br>
	  UPDATE:
	  <br>
	  today is friday, april 28, 2023... me and teammate O worked on the implementation of tab photos. we came accross many problems in which we installed more software (<a href="https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/">SF SYmbols</a>) exported template to resize our icone and turned them into UI images. then we used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitabbarcontroller">UIKITTOOLBARCONTROLLER</a> to implement the icons into our tab. IT WORKED! however, we got as far as begining implementation and ran out of class time to work so Teammate O will be pushing it over the weekend hopefully.
	  <br>
	  another thing i worked on to progress and finalize our ISP was teh post function in our loggin page. since teammate O was helping me with the image/icon ordeal, i wanted to help him with the post functionality. some would say a "buzzer beater" finish because we got it working, finished, and pushed to the repository just minutes before bell! im happy because teammate o was working on post fuctionality for a week or two. so im sad to say that i dont have any commits under my name this week, but have contributed and been accredited for helping with the post functionality in the comit coment.
	  <br>
	  side note: the post functionality is more important than image icons in my opinion because the post functionality allows members to log in and assign/create new shelters on our app. the icons are mainly for aesthetic. So in my opinion i did complete a significant acheivment because i was a major help with teh post functionalityh DESPITE not being the one to commit it.
	  <br>

	  <br>
	  i also want to say that apples documentation isnt helpful at all, somewhat even more confusing. IT DIDNT ANSWER ANY OF MY QUESTIONS. It just made me question myself more!
	  <br>
	  here is a link/picture of the post functionality and my accreditation of helping solve this major problem.

UPDATE: today is friday april 21st, i have made progress, not as much as i would like to have done however. I have fully imported and implemented our logo/app icon to be the face of the app into our project, i am encountering issues with unwrapping the tab icons however. i will be working with others to get it done by the weekend. and i have made progress with my home situation and xcode, with my new computer i have downloaded a vm (wirtual machine) and now have access to Xcode via a macOS monterey system on a virtual machine!

      Technical challenges:
      <br>
      One technical challange I encountered this week is WIFI. Working at school is hard enough but when we dont have strong connection to the interenet its nearly impossible! Not only was wifif a problem, I started research on how I want to contribute to the project by starting to design the front page.
      <br>
      <br>

      Scheduling challenges:
      <br>
      Scheduling challenges from this week include non-productivity and no progress moving forward on our ISP. as a group we havent made any more progress in the past week nor have we created a plan or a schedule to follow.

      <br>
      <br>

      Interpersonal challenges:
      <br>
      One interpersonal challenge i encountered this week was time management and procrasination. this week has been on go go go mode, not taking a brake and taking things in. I need to slow down and truly understand what i am learning especially when its something i dont understand.

Technical challenge:
<br>
this weeks technical challenge was believe it or not, communication! if you couldnt tell, communication in my group is a problem and fairly diffficult. its a technical challenge becuase it evolves into minimal work completion. another technical challenge for myself is Xcode, since i can not open xcode on my computer, i cannot view or use our application and see all the feats we have achieved or what we still need to do. 
<br>
<br>

Scheduling challenge:
<br>
as always there are no plans and a reoccuring scheduling challenge with my ISP and my group. I dont think we have every all gotten together and decided on something or worked any problems out as a group. some of us (including me) dont even know what we are supposed to be doing now due to the lack of communication. i can add that i have completed my job as ui or graphic design and created images and icons for our app. at this point in time i have moved on and stopped complaining with my group. with the little communication we have i try to help and contribute as much as i can. i have also started doing more work on a seperate project of mine as i am filling and completing the website for the scanner project. i try to be helpful to my isp group and create issues that are inherent over our project but at this point in time i feel useless and distant from my group.
<br>
<br>

interpersonal challenge:
<br>
one interpersonal challenge this week was a time balance and communication. I was working on many things this week and felt that i did not contribute as much as i could have to the ISP. I wish i could accsess and visualize our project in my own time so i can work on it and progress it even further. instead i have to rely on my peers. To be honest I feel useless in this project and am feeling like i havent contributed anything. and its true, the whole ordeal with XCODE, my computer, and this large group has really hit me hard. i havent contributed much at all to this project, less than i wished to and/or even intended to. Xcode is right now the BANE of my existance and because of XCODE i feel like a nimrod, a useless person who is using others to their advantage. and i honestly never intended for this to happen.

Technical challenge:
<br>
this weeks technical challenge was not necessarily for the isp, in fact it was for the missions we had to complete. this week i learned about nodes. for me nodes are a technical challenge because comming into the mission i had no idea they existed. tyhrough the course of the week, i became slightly more comfortable with nodes and how they work. with help from peers i could grasp the concept comfortably and overcome this challenge.

      Technical challenges:
      <br>
      Some technical challenges I experienced this week were uncalled for. I was working in the shell and somehow got locked out. I couldn't access the shell through tabby nor through guacamole. So I restarted my computer and still had no luck. Eventually I just let it sit and dwell alone and a few days later it was back! Weird right. I was completely locked out for a day or two. That's the only technical challenge that occurred this week probably because i couldn't do anything else to work on my project.

      Scheduling challenges from this week include non-productivity and no progress moving forward on our ISP. as a group we havent made any more progress in the past week nor have we created a plan or a schedule to follow. another challenge we encountered this week was that many people are refusing to do work or doing very little work due to the lack of communication. Sadly im one of those people, i feel that i could have brought much more to this project but instead im completly lost with nothing to do and am making no progress.

      Interpesonal challenge:
      <br>
      one interpersonal challenge i encountered this week was communication. This week was different since it was the first week back from spring break and everyone refused to do work with tha vacation and end of year mindset. another interpesonal challenge that i encountered was motivation. right now in my head is racing college this college that since im a senior in high school, i struggle tol motivate myself to do long projects like this one occasinaly.
       <br>
      <br>
      Technical challenges:
      <br>
      hmmmm. i wonder what the problem was this week... OH I know! Computers! technically its just xcode. Since I am not exposed to the pplatform of xcode i am unaware on how to use it so im on a learning curve while also trying to make progress on a project. however i can only learn how to use xcode in class, this is because my computer is outdated and cannot run the software. so at home i do research on how to use xcode and when i do have time in class, i try to work out how to use xcode. it also doesnt help that i dont know what half of our code is doing because its very ominous and spread out in many files that have very similar names.
      <br>
      <br>
      Scheduling challenges:
      <br>
      the schediling challenge this week was just time. we had a three day week this week, so this means less working days and even less communication. we did get a presentation made for our minimum viable product(mvp) but it was difficult because many people start workingon this group project with speaking their intentions. we are also behind on schedule of our gantt chart to create the MVP because of many variables such as time and work ethic. also, our github is an organized mess if that makes sense, each person has a branch so in total we have 15 branches with different variations of code on each branch. but the main thing is, I DONT KNOW WHAT IM SUPPOSED TO BE DOING WHEN because there is no communication on what needs to be done first or at all in general.

      Interpersonal challenge:
      <br>
      one interpersonal challenge i encountered this week was motivation. this week is the week before spring break with many deviations in our normal schedule like SAT day and a half day. This week i wasnt as productive as i would have hoped to be. Without motivation to complete or even work on my own project. generally im motivated no matter what but i need a break and need to reecoop my thoughts and ideas.
      <br>
      <br>
      Technical challenge:
      <br>
      this weeks technical challenge was with no suprise my computer. with even less time than normal i couldnt get nearly as much done with my time due to technology restrictions. another technical challenge i came accross was when i was working on my second project in which i  was placing objects on the front  page. i was unable to move thing saround to where i wanted i believe due to the size an boarder restrictions placed on the object; however i was able to create a very functional page filled with meaningful information over our scanner.

      Interpersonal challenges:
      <br>
      one interpersonal challenge i encountered this week was communication. This week was a short week since we only had three days of school, so this limited the amount of work i could get done on our ISP because in class is the only time i have accsess to Xcode. today, me and a group member got into a small argument, i was asking 'person X' what i should do to add to the project this week, but 'X' couldnt think of anything and so i started doing research on Xcode properties and how to efficiently use Xcode so i can get things done in class. Later on they got mad at me for not working on the project during class BUT what am i supposed to do if there isnt a lgical next step for me to take on the front end! anyways we argued and 'x' brought up the fact that im never working on the project but thats because of two reasons. 1. there is no communication in the gruip so i dont know what others expect me to do. 2. I cant use xcode so i start doing my volunteer project and make significant progress on that with people WHO DO COMMUNICATE.

      <br>
One interpersonal challenge this week was project stabilizations. Shocking right! it wasnt time!! this is because now that my volunteer project has started gaining movement and progress im juggling two major projects at once and im struggling to prioritize one over the other. this side project of mine is more interesting to me, it is easier to communicate with my small group and im enjoying it quite abit. i have designed an amazing loking website... which i will link below because I know your dying of curiosity. but this prioritization of projects and ideas is a major personal challenge for me this week.

      Scheduling challenges:
      <br>
oof scheduling challenges. everyday is a challenge in this ISP because im only able to communicate with two of the ten people in my group. THATS OUTRAGEOUS! anyways one scheduling challenge i had this week was ... actually i dont think i had one. this week was very slow, i got all my work for both projects done on time if not early the only thing that caught me off gaurd is my commit contribution in which im struggling to do due to inferior technology resources at home whihc ill be getting to.
      <br>
      <br>
      Technical challneges:
 <br>     AH technology. technology and i have a love hate relationship. my computer cant run xCode and when i go to class i spen all my time trying to understand how to use xCode to the point where i never get a chance to commit my changes. I have mad advancments on icons and logos for our app, which is a major app as im the intended UX engineer? (i think, i may be wrong i may be UI). On the otherhand, this week i worked on how to use FTP on ubuntu to transfer files from computer to shell! YAY!

      Interpersonal challenges:
      <br>
      one interpersonal challenge i've had this week was -- well you guessed it -- time! this week has been hectic and busy with no time to work. however i did make progress on a side (volunteer project) and i have started designin the webpage and logo for my ISP. time is also a scheduling challenge for me because of my courseload and self rigor i take upon myself.

      Scheduling challenges:
      <br>
      this week there was a scheduling success rather than a challenge! we finally made a schedule (gantt chart) and have started working on our page! I have finally got stuff to do and am excited but terrified at the same time. This week i started on th elogo for our app, this will be the first impression carrier as an apps logo is the face of the application. I also finally got accsess to developing the front end of the webpage... UI design I beieve!-it may be UX ill have to check-. also I dont know who ill be working with BUT its gaurenteed because we have a large group.

      Technical challenges
      <br>
Alas, the dreaded technical challenge, as we all know, my computer isnt the best and doesnt work with Xcode, so i have been scrappping the fingertips on what ive been able to contribute. however, I may have made progress in my quest of begging for a new computer... Updates coming soon!. however the technical challenge is still the same as last week as i cn only work on my ISP during school hours or blinbdly work and experiment on what i am doing.

      Interpersonal challenges:

      one personal challenge for me is our team size and communicating to this large group. the shelterSafe team is a group of ten people, and many dont have an indea on what to do or how to contribute to the project. since we are not in direct contact with the entire group it also makes things difficult to assign and credit others work. I also dont want to create a design that is unlike how others interperet the project being because everyone has a very different aesthetic and my strongly disagree with my ideas in how to present our app.  Another challenge for me is well technology. I have a very old computer and it isnt always compatable with things and resources we need for school. So the only way i can work on my part of the project is in class but we never have class time to do it.

      Scheduling challenges:
      <br>
      TIME. time is my biggest enemy. this week i had taken over 4 tests and a numerous amount of quizes and assesments in wich all my time goes into. I never get downtime to work on projects unless im up until 1 am, which for me is physically impossible -- i crash at like 10. Time is something very limited so getting a brainstorming idea page down is progress for me. now comes the hard part - implementing it. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Technical challenge:
      <br>
one technical challenge for me is resources. like i said earlier, My computer doesnt allow me to work on x-code, its so old its incompatable with the software. so i have two options spend the little time i have in class working on it and make slow progress or blindly work on my computer terminal where i cant see what i am doing. the latter option is much more risky and extremly inconveinient but its time to start solving this problem because I have in mind now what i want to reate it, now im just need to work on the how.

      Technical challenges:
      <br>
      One technical challange I encountered this week is WIFI. Working at school is hard enough but when we dont have strong connection to the interenet its nearly impossible! Not only was wifif a problem, I started research on how I want to contribute to the project by starting to design the front page.
      <br>
      <br>

      Scheduling challenges:
      <br>
      Scheduling challenges from this week include non-productivity and no progress moving forward on our ISP. as a group we havent made any more progress in the past week nor have we created a plan or a schedule to follow.

      <br>

      Interpersonal challenges:
      <br>
      One interpersonal challenge i encountered this week was time management and procrasination. this week has been on go go go mode, not taking a brake and taking things in. I need to slow down and truly understand what i am learning especially when its something i dont understand.

	  Technical challenges
	  <br>
One technical challenge that I encountered this week is setting up the GIT repository on my shell. I thought i had it all ready and then I wasnt able to push my changes for the documentation. after changing the origin branch and merging my changes with my team mates i was finally able to push my changes on the documentatin file.

	  Scheduling challenges
	  <br>
Since we are just starting our ISP, we havent had time to make a shedule for our group to follow. due to this, and our own personal schedules we havent had time to discuss our plans. Some scheduling challenges that we have encountered so far is that since we are not able to get together as a big group we havent been able to discuss challeneges nor what the main idea is for the project so that everyone is on the same track.

	  Interpersonal challenges 
	  <br>
Communications with other teammates is an interpersonal challenge for me. Since I am not a very ougoing person, communicating with people i dont know is difficult.This can make it hard to work with people and get a fully functional project going. so talking and planning with the rest of the group is my downfall.

      (Software) Development Engineer:
      <br>
      The role of software engineers focuses on applying the principles of engineering to software development. This includes analyzing and modifying existing software as well as designing, constructing and testing end-user applications. I personally believe that im not qualified to do this job currently but hope to be soon as i gain more knowledge and become more comfortable coding in many different languages. so I highly believe that I am unsiutable for this position. I would work at a turtles pace and will be no help to the growth of the project. Some challenges I expect to encounter would be many proporties and variables working not as you intended, having to do lots of research and self study, as well as many run of trial and error until you get a desired product. 
      <br>
      <br>

      QA Engineer:
      <br>
       A QA engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before a product launch. These tests entail other tasks such as developing and running new tests and reporting their results to stakeholders, who will collaborate to fix program bugs or problems. I believe that I could potentially be somewhat suitable for this job. Though I would like to express my talents in color scheme and artistic ability in our project, i would be well suited for this aswell. Being a QA engineer will allow me to have hands on experience with the bulk of the code as i would be testing and looking for problems that i can pass on or evidently fix. some challanges i would think to encounter would be time, testing can take hours if not days and with my schedule its hard to devote so much time.
      <br>
      <br>

      Project Manager:
      <br>
       Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve all project goals within the given constraints. I have previously held this role before and believe that I didnt do that well considering I couldnt hold much authority and that nothing was done on time for the project. so despite my past experiences in this job field, i dont believe im properly suited for this. Some challenges i think one will encounter would be communicating and time management. its not just you your organizing its the entire project, and many know highschoolers tend to procrasinate no matter how much one beggs. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Product Manager:
      <br>
      Product management is the business process of planning, developing, launching, and managing a product or service. It includes the entire lifecycle of a product, from ideation to development to go to market. The product manager is responsible for the product quality and the product as a whole, they are incharge of ensurine a proper product is going out to the public. I believe that i can be suitable for this job if i am not allowed to be incharge of design or look of the final peice. Some challanges i believe would come with this job is working with others, in order to create a perfect product you have to be able to critique work and for some that an be a hard thing to do.
      <br>
      <br>

      Release Engineer:
      <br>
      the release engineer is a sub-discipline in software engineering concerned with the compilation, assembly, and delivery of source code into finished products or other software components. I believe that i am quite qualified for this job. I would love to be able to get this job because it will allow me to learn more as i will have to know the ins and outs of the entire product to create comments and an overview in normal terms. I believe that the challenges in this would be juggling many components at once and having to be looking at everything going on in the project.
