	  Technical challenges
	  <br>
One technical challenge that I encountered this week is setting up the GIT repository on my shell. I thought i had it all ready and then I wasnt able to push my changes for the documentation. after changing the origin branch and merging my changes with my team mates i was finally able to push my changes on the documentatin file.

	  <br>
	  
	  Scheduling challenges
	  <br>
Since we are just starting our ISP, we havent had time to make a shedule for our group to follow. due to this, and our own personal schedules we havent had time to discuss our plans. Some scheduling challenges that we have encountered so far is that since we are not able to get together as a big group we havent been able to discuss challeneges nor what the main idea is for the project so that everyone is on the same track.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  Interpersonal challenges 
	  <br>
Communications with other teammates is an interpersonal challenge for me. Since I am not a very ougoing person, communicating with people i dont know is difficult.This can make it hard to work with people and get a fully functional project going. so talking and planning with the rest of the group is my downfall.

      (Software) Development Engineer:
      <br>
      The role of software engineers focuses on applying the principles of engineering to software development. This includes analyzing and modifying existing software as well as designing, constructing and testing end-user applications. I personally believe that im not qualified to do this job currently but hope to be soon as i gain more knowledge and become more comfortable coding in many different languages. so I highly believe that I am unsiutable for this position. I would work at a turtles pace and will be no help to the growth of the project. Some challenges I expect to encounter would be many proporties and variables working not as you intended, having to do lots of research and self study, as well as many run of trial and error until you get a desired product. 
      <br>
      <br>

      QA Engineer:
      <br>
       A QA engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before a product launch. These tests entail other tasks such as developing and running new tests and reporting their results to stakeholders, who will collaborate to fix program bugs or problems. I believe that I could potentially be somewhat suitable for this job. Though I would like to express my talents in color scheme and artistic ability in our project, i would be well suited for this aswell. Being a QA engineer will allow me to have hands on experience with the bulk of the code as i would be testing and looking for problems that i can pass on or evidently fix. some challanges i would think to encounter would be time, testing can take hours if not days and with my schedule its hard to devote so much time.
      <br>
      <br>

      Project Manager:
      <br>
       Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve all project goals within the given constraints. I have previously held this role before and believe that I didnt do that well considering I couldnt hold much authority and that nothing was done on time for the project. so despite my past experiences in this job field, i dont believe im properly suited for this. Some challenges i think one will encounter would be communicating and time management. its not just you your organizing its the entire project, and many know highschoolers tend to procrasinate no matter how much one beggs. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Product Manager:
      <br>
      Product management is the business process of planning, developing, launching, and managing a product or service. It includes the entire lifecycle of a product, from ideation to development to go to market. The product manager is responsible for the product quality and the product as a whole, they are incharge of ensurine a proper product is going out to the public. I believe that i can be suitable for this job if i am not allowed to be incharge of design or look of the final peice. Some challanges i believe would come with this job is working with others, in order to create a perfect product you have to be able to critique work and for some that an be a hard thing to do.
      <br>
      <br>

      Release Engineer:
      <br>
      the release engineer is a sub-discipline in software engineering concerned with the compilation, assembly, and delivery of source code into finished products or other software components. I believe that i am quite qualified for this job. I would love to be able to get this job because it will allow me to learn more as i will have to know the ins and outs of the entire product to create comments and an overview in normal terms. I believe that the challenges in this would be juggling many components at once and having to be looking at everything going on in the project.
