      Interpersonal challenges:
      <br>
One interpersonal challenge this week was project stabilizations. Shocking right! it wasnt time!! this is because now that my volunteer project has started gaining movement and progress im juggling two major projects at once and im struggling to prioritize one over the other. this side project of mine is more interesting to me, it is easier to communicate with my small group and im enjoying it quite abit. i have designed an amazing loking website... which i will link below because I know your dying of curiosity. but this prioritization of projects and ideas is a major personal challenge for me this week.
      <br>
      <br>
      Scheduling challenges:
      <br>
oof scheduling challenges. everyday is a challenge in this ISP because im only able to communicate with two of the ten people in my group. THATS OUTRAGEOUS! anyways one scheduling challenge i had this week was ... actually i dont think i had one. this week was very slow, i got all my work for both projects done on time if not early the only thing that caught me off gaurd is my commit contribution in which im struggling to do due to inferior technology resources at home whihc ill be getting to.
      <br>
      <br>
      Technical challneges:
 <br>     AH technology. technology and i have a love hate relationship. my computer cant run xCode and when i go to class i spen all my time trying to understand how to use xCode to the point where i never get a chance to commit my changes. I have mad advancments on icons and logos for our app, which is a major app as im the intended UX engineer? (i think, i may be wrong i may be UI). On the otherhand, this week i worked on how to use FTP on ubuntu to transfer files from computer to shell! YAY!

      Interpersonal challenges:
      <br>
      one interpersonal challenge i've had this week was -- well you guessed it -- time! this week has been hectic and busy with no time to work. however i did make progress on a side (volunteer project) and i have started designin the webpage and logo for my ISP. time is also a scheduling challenge for me because of my courseload and self rigor i take upon myself.


      <br>
      <br>
      Scheduling challenges:
      <br>
      this week there was a scheduling success rather than a challenge! we finally made a schedule (gantt chart) and have started working on our page! I have finally got stuff to do and am excited but terrified at the same time. This week i started on th elogo for our app, this will be the first impression carrier as an apps logo is the face of the application. I also finally got accsess to developing the front end of the webpage... UI design I beieve!-it may be UX ill have to check-. also I dont know who ill be working with BUT its gaurenteed because we have a large group.

      <br>
      <br>

      Technical challenges
      <br>
Alas, the dreaded technical challenge, as we all know, my computer isnt the best and doesnt work with Xcode, so i have been scrappping the fingertips on what ive been able to contribute. however, I may have made progress in my quest of begging for a new computer... Updates coming soon!. however the technical challenge is still the same as last week as i cn only work on my ISP during school hours or blinbdly work and experiment on what i am doing.

      Interpersonal challenges:

      one personal challenge for me is our team size and communicating to this large group. the shelterSafe team is a group of ten people, and many dont have an indea on what to do or how to contribute to the project. since we are not in direct contact with the entire group it also makes things difficult to assign and credit others work. I also dont want to create a design that is unlike how others interperet the project being because everyone has a very different aesthetic and my strongly disagree with my ideas in how to present our app.  Another challenge for me is well technology. I have a very old computer and it isnt always compatable with things and resources we need for school. So the only way i can work on my part of the project is in class but we never have class time to do it.
      <br>
      <br>
      Scheduling challenges:
      <br>
      TIME. time is my biggest enemy. this week i had taken over 4 tests and a numerous amount of quizes and assesments in wich all my time goes into. I never get downtime to work on projects unless im up until 1 am, which for me is physically impossible -- i crash at like 10. Time is something very limited so getting a brainstorming idea page down is progress for me. now comes the hard part - implementing it. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Technical challenge:
      <br>
one technical challenge for me is resources. like i said earlier, My computer doesnt allow me to work on x-code, its so old its incompatable with the software. so i have two options spend the little time i have in class working on it and make slow progress or blindly work on my computer terminal where i cant see what i am doing. the latter option is much more risky and extremly inconveinient but its time to start solving this problem because I have in mind now what i want to reate it, now im just need to work on the how.

      Technical challenges:
      <br>
      One technical challange I encountered this week is WIFI. Working at school is hard enough but when we dont have strong connection to the interenet its nearly impossible! Not only was wifif a problem, I started research on how I want to contribute to the project by starting to design the front page.
      <br>
      <br>

      Scheduling challenges:
      <br>
      Scheduling challenges from this week include non-productivity and no progress moving forward on our ISP. as a group we havent made any more progress in the past week nor have we created a plan or a schedule to follow.

      <br>
      <br>

      Interpersonal challenges:
      <br>
      One interpersonal challenge i encountered this week was time management and procrasination. this week has been on go go go mode, not taking a brake and taking things in. I need to slow down and truly understand what i am learning especially when its something i dont understand.
      <br>

	  Technical challenges
	  <br>
One technical challenge that I encountered this week is setting up the GIT repository on my shell. I thought i had it all ready and then I wasnt able to push my changes for the documentation. after changing the origin branch and merging my changes with my team mates i was finally able to push my changes on the documentatin file.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  Scheduling challenges
	  <br>
Since we are just starting our ISP, we havent had time to make a shedule for our group to follow. due to this, and our own personal schedules we havent had time to discuss our plans. Some scheduling challenges that we have encountered so far is that since we are not able to get together as a big group we havent been able to discuss challeneges nor what the main idea is for the project so that everyone is on the same track.
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  Interpersonal challenges 
	  <br>
Communications with other teammates is an interpersonal challenge for me. Since I am not a very ougoing person, communicating with people i dont know is difficult.This can make it hard to work with people and get a fully functional project going. so talking and planning with the rest of the group is my downfall.

       <br>
       
      (Software) Development Engineer:
      <br>
      The role of software engineers focuses on applying the principles of engineering to software development. This includes analyzing and modifying existing software as well as designing, constructing and testing end-user applications. I personally believe that im not qualified to do this job currently but hope to be soon as i gain more knowledge and become more comfortable coding in many different languages. so I highly believe that I am unsiutable for this position. I would work at a turtles pace and will be no help to the growth of the project. Some challenges I expect to encounter would be many proporties and variables working not as you intended, having to do lots of research and self study, as well as many run of trial and error until you get a desired product. 
      <br>
      <br>

      QA Engineer:
      <br>
       A QA engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before a product launch. These tests entail other tasks such as developing and running new tests and reporting their results to stakeholders, who will collaborate to fix program bugs or problems. I believe that I could potentially be somewhat suitable for this job. Though I would like to express my talents in color scheme and artistic ability in our project, i would be well suited for this aswell. Being a QA engineer will allow me to have hands on experience with the bulk of the code as i would be testing and looking for problems that i can pass on or evidently fix. some challanges i would think to encounter would be time, testing can take hours if not days and with my schedule its hard to devote so much time.
      <br>
      <br>

      Project Manager:
      <br>
       Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve all project goals within the given constraints. I have previously held this role before and believe that I didnt do that well considering I couldnt hold much authority and that nothing was done on time for the project. so despite my past experiences in this job field, i dont believe im properly suited for this. Some challenges i think one will encounter would be communicating and time management. its not just you your organizing its the entire project, and many know highschoolers tend to procrasinate no matter how much one beggs. 
      <br>
      <br>

      Product Manager:
      <br>
      Product management is the business process of planning, developing, launching, and managing a product or service. It includes the entire lifecycle of a product, from ideation to development to go to market. The product manager is responsible for the product quality and the product as a whole, they are incharge of ensurine a proper product is going out to the public. I believe that i can be suitable for this job if i am not allowed to be incharge of design or look of the final peice. Some challanges i believe would come with this job is working with others, in order to create a perfect product you have to be able to critique work and for some that an be a hard thing to do.
      <br>
      <br>

      Release Engineer:
      <br>
      the release engineer is a sub-discipline in software engineering concerned with the compilation, assembly, and delivery of source code into finished products or other software components. I believe that i am quite qualified for this job. I would love to be able to get this job because it will allow me to learn more as i will have to know the ins and outs of the entire product to create comments and an overview in normal terms. I believe that the challenges in this would be juggling many components at once and having to be looking at everything going on in the project.
