      i would decline bolt.
      though Bolt could be a very useful tool in helping students with computer science, or even in other subjects should the creators choose to broaden the scope a bit. there are multiple platforms that already provide such amenities. and leaving a "social media" platform unattended, it can be missused. i just dont understand the fascination over having hundreds of talking/communication platforms. and i dont want to be a part of something that can potentially be misused or misleading for others.

      i would declines bolt because its not restraint friendly. food allergies and fears are allways going to be a clash with this program.
      I have found myself wondering what I should do with my friends many times. This app would help make that go away, and could even take us places we hadn’t known existed. however, not everyone is going to enjoy a destination picker. for instance, im terrified of heights, but this app sends me to a skydiving place, im going to be upset. and some people may already have this application available to them, for instance, i have a destination picker built into my cars interface.

      i find it a bit confusing, so i decline this idea.
      This project description makes it sound like there would be multiple smaller projects under this big project, therefore many parts and peices to work on and experijment with. YAY! learning new things!. This would help advance skills in a wider range.However  i dont find it appealing to both use and create. if i dont like it then i wont have the heart to work on it with 110% effort. im also very lost on this idea. so i cant accept the idea.

      i decline olivers idea, because although it is very intruging and interesting, i dont think i will benefeit the group. i genuinly like the idea, but dont trust my abilities to participate in an AI oriented project.
      This project would be very interesting to work on, and I would learn a lot, because I’ve never worked with any form of facial recognition before. In implementation, it would be a noticeable improvement in schools, with less errors in attendance and reducing the class time taken up by calling roll. however, i looking to be beneficial and play a role in the project, and this just isnt for me.

      i decline theFit because im not a very fashionable person. what i like to wear and what society has called fashion are two completly different categories. i dont want to be responsible styling someone who is uncomfortable or weary of certain types of clothing. though There have been mornings when I wanted someone to tell me what to wear, and that is exactly what this app would do i dont think it would be beneficial to everyone. on the other hand,  It would be interesting to figure out how to filter ideas by the user’s preferences and to present outfits that for a certain aesthetic with only items currently in someone’s closet.

      Goose Simulator: A Not So Ordinary Goose Game

      I’ve played games like this before, like Goat Simulator, and found it extremely fun. Creating something like it that is just ridiculous would be extremely fun. I also think it would be fun to hide some easter eggs and fun little hidden challenges and such, and this game would allow for that very easily. however, i particpated in a group last year to create a fun game and near the end we were rushing and it wasnt enjoyable. i also dont want to only have games on my CS resume, i want to create an application that is benneficial to users. so i decline the proposal, though intruiging, i want to have a beneficial impact on the community.

      Many people would benefit from an app that helps with scheduling and productivity. Despite most phones coming with some form of calendar app, many people don’t use it for more than big events, instead of small productivity things. Working on such an app would be beneficial to me, because I could use something like that, as well as fun to figure out how to differentiate this from other scheduling products. HOWEVER, only last year did we work on a scheduling app, though different concepts, they are very similar. i want to expand my project background further than games and calanders, i want to create programs thatll be usefull to others, outside of students.

      Despite not eating in the cafeteria myself, I’ve heard many stories about people waiting in long lines and having only 2 or 3 minutes to actually eat their food. This concept of ordering food beforehand would really help in getting students their food quicker, and it has been proven to work on days like the PSAT, where students order their lunch before and get it at a certain time. though this may be extremley helpful and beneficial to students who spend most of their lunch time standing in line, inventory, and menue meals will always be restricted or out of date. this idea will have to be linked to the school inventory system, and i dont beleive we will get permissions for this. so thats why i decline it. its not an attainable program to develope, if it cant be properly used in the future by allen schools.

      Castaway

      Castaway is our own proposal. It is useful and would be very challenging to create, with many filters and destinations. though This would make planning a trip so much easier and help making memories so much easier, it will require lots of time, dedication, and resources to properly create. i would do this as a side personal project sometime innorder to better my life when planning trips for the family. but i dont think its attainable given the time we have during the school year to make a proper functioning travel planner.

ShelterSafe is a project that, while maybe being less useful in north Texas, would be very useful in many areas of the world more prone to natural disasters. It would be very rewarding to work on something that could noticeably help many people. I chose this proposal because not only is this a attainable project, it is beneficial to the community in and out of allen. this is a programm that can be used to the benefit of others. i also beleive that i can be extremly helpful to the group, with reasearch and code.
