      Bolt:
      <br>
      i would decline bolt.
      though Bolt could be a very useful tool in helping students with computer science, or even in other subjects should the creators choose to broaden the scope a bit. there are multiple platforms that already provide such amenities. and leaving a "social media" platform unattended, it can be missused. i just dont understand the fascination over having hundreds of talking/communication platforms. and i dont want to be a part of something that can potentially be misused or misleading for others.
      
      <br>
      <br>
      
     Let’sGo:
      <br>
      i would declines bolt because its not restraint friendly. food allergies and fears are allways going to be a clash with this program.
      I have found myself wondering what I should do with my friends many times. This app would help make that go away, and could even take us places we hadn’t known existed. however, not everyone is going to enjoy a destination picker. for instance, im terrified of heights, but this app sends me to a skydiving place, im going to be upset. and some people may already have this application available to them, for instance, i have a destination picker built into my cars interface.

      i find it a bit confusing, so i decline this idea.
      This project description makes it sound like there would be multiple smaller projects under this big project, therefore many parts and peices to work on and experijment with. YAY! learning new things!. This would help advance skills in a wider range.However  i dont find it appealing to both use and create. if i dont like it then i wont have the heart to work on it with 110% effort. im also very lost on this idea. so i cant accept the idea.

      <br>
      i decline olivers idea, because although it is very intruging and interesting, i dont think i will benefeit the group. i genuinly like the idea, but dont trust my abilities to participate in an AI oriented project.
      This project would be very interesting to work on, and I would learn a lot, because I’ve never worked with any form of facial recognition before. In implementation, it would be a noticeable improvement in schools, with less errors in attendance and reducing the class time taken up by calling roll. however, i looking to be beneficial and play a role in the project, and this just isnt for me.

      TheFit:
      <br>
      i decline theFit because im not a very fashionable person. what i like to wear and what society has called fashion are two completly different categories. i dont want to be responsible styling someone who is uncomfortable or weary of certain types of clothing. though There have been mornings when I wanted someone to tell me what to wear, and that is exactly what this app would do i dont think it would be beneficial to everyone. on the other hand,  It would be interesting to figure out how to filter ideas by the user’s preferences and to present outfits that for a certain aesthetic with only items currently in someone’s closet.

      Goose Simulator: A Not So Ordinary Goose Game
      <br>
      
      I’ve played games like this before, like Goat Simulator, and found it extremely fun. Creating something like it that is just ridiculous would be extremely fun. I also think it would be fun to hide some easter eggs and fun little hidden challenges and such, and this game would allow for that very easily. however, i particpated in a group last year to create a fun game and near the end we were rushing and it wasnt enjoyable. i also dont want to only have games on my CS resume, i want to create an application that is benneficial to users. so i decline the proposal, though intruiging, i want to have a beneficial impact on the community.

      Many people would benefit from an app that helps with scheduling and productivity. Despite most phones coming with some form of calendar app, many people don’t use it for more than big events, instead of small productivity things. Working on such an app would be beneficial to me, because I could use something like that, as well as fun to figure out how to differentiate this from other scheduling products.
